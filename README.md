**Hygge Desk** is a short RPG set in a Scandinavian atmosphere. The player takes on the role of Olaf, an old lumberjack who is nearing retirement and dreams of a peaceful life. His plan is to spend his days admiring the beautiful landscapes of his homeland and writing runic poetry. However, to fully enjoy this time, he needs a solid desk.  

His friend **Torlof**, the best carpenter in Alesund, has promised to craft one for him. Olaf must chop down trees, gather wood, and deliver it to Torlof until the desk is completed. Each night, the tree regenerates, providing another chance to collect resources.  

Will Olaf manage to gather enough wood and finally sit at his dream desk?
